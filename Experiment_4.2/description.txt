Build a RESTful API using Express.js to manage a dynamic collection of playing cards.
This project introduces core concepts of routing, HTTP methods, and data handling in Node.js.
Card data is stored in-memory, allowing quick prototyping without a database.
The API supports operations like listing, adding, retrieving, and deleting cards.

 Key Features
- GET /cards: Retrieve the full list of playing cards.
- POST /cards: Add a new card with suit and value properties.
- GET /cards/:id: Fetch a specific card by its unique ID.
- DELETE /cards/:id: Remove a card from the collection using its ID.
- In-memory storage: All card data is stored in a simple array for ease of use.

 Learning Outcomes
- Understand how to set up and configure an Express.js server.
- Learn to define RESTful routes and handle different HTTP methods.
- Practice working with request bodies and dynamic route parameters.
- Explore basic CRUD operations without using a database.
- Gain confidence in building and testing APIs using tools like Postman
